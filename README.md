**Brief summary of climate findings:**
* Though we would expect the temperature to increase in more recent years based on current climate trends, the opposite is true for the past 10 years in Dinosaur, CO. This is evident when considering that the average temperature during the first five years of the time frame was greater than the second five years of the time frame.
* Furthermore, when examining the yearly data provided above, there does not seem to be a clear trend in temperature. There is no obvious relationship between the year and the first occurrence of a temperature greater than the annual mean in 2014, and the number of days in which the maximum temperature exceeds 30 degrees is variable across the ten years, This may be due to lack of crucial data points, which indicates that a deeper statistical analysis is necessary.

**Reflection on Your experience with this assignment:**
* I had an overall good experience with this project and found it useful for getting back into the groove of using java
* It was slightly difficult to ignore methods at which coding this project would be easier (using ArrayLists) but I thought it was a good exercise to restrict myself to certain data structures in order to understand the capabilities of arrays more
* I also thought it was interesting to follow specific document guidelines because I have never stressed the importance of commenting code, especially since a lot of my coding experience comes from just learning on my personal time
